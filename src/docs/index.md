Research in our group focuses on developing advanced computational methods by integrating statistical mechanics, molecular dynamics, and machine learning. Leveraging these powerful and innovative techniques, we aim to tackle complex challenges in chemistry and biophysics. Our primary focus is on addressing critical problems related to computational drug design, sampling of biomolecular conformational ensembles, coarse-grained force field development, and multiscale modeling of biomolecular condensates.
